### 🗓️ Project Duration
November 2023 - November 2023

<br>

### 🔍 Key Features
#### 📂 Data Sources
1. Session Details Sheet: Contains date-wise session counts, including listing sessions, menu sessions, cart sessions, payment sessions, and order sessions. <br>
2. Channel-wise Traffic Sheet: Provides traffic (listing sessions) breakdown by date and channel. <br>
3. Supporting Data Sheet: Includes additional information such as the count of restaurants, average discount, out-of-stock items per restaurant, average packaging charges, average delivery charges, average cost for two, number of images per restaurant, and success rate of payments.

<br>
   
### 🛠️ Data Analysis Steps
#### Session Analysis:
- Filled in the remaining columns of the Session Details sheet based on provided definitions.
- Identified dates of highs and lows in orders compared to the same day the previous week, using a threshold of ±20% to define significant changes.
  
#### Traffic Analysis:
- Compared traffic changes to the same day the previous week.
- Identified sources of traffic changes using the Channel-wise Traffic sheet.
  
#### Conversion Analysis:
- Broke down overall conversion into smaller parts (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O).
- Created fresh columns for these metrics in the Session Details sheet.
- Identified fluctuations in specific conversions.
- Formulated hypotheses on potential causes for conversion fluctuations and validated them using the Supporting Data sheet.

### 📈 Insights and Recommendations:
#### Listing to Menu (L2M) Conversions:
- Identified significant increases and decreases in L2M conversions.
- Hypothesized that an increase in the number of images per restaurant and a decrease in out-of-stock items positively impacted L2M conversions.
- Recommended enhancing visual content and ensuring better stock management.

#### Menu to Cart (M2C) Conversions:
- Observed fluctuations in M2C conversions due to changes in delivery charges and packaging charges.
- Suggested optimizing delivery and packaging fees to maintain consistent M2C conversions.

#### Cart to Payment (C2P) Conversions:
- Analyzed the impact of availability of restaurants, delivery charges, and out-of-stock items on C2P conversions.
- Recommended improving restaurant availability and managing delivery charges to enhance C2P conversions.

#### Payment to Order (P2O) Conversions:
- Identified issues such as high out-of-stock items and lower success rates of payments affecting P2O conversions.
- Proposed strategies to improve inventory management and payment process efficiency.

<br>

### 📊 Visualization:
- Visualized the conversion rates at each stage of the funnel (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O).
- Created charts to compare traffic changes and conversion metrics over time.
